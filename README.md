# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! Here, you will find a collection of projects that showcase my skills and experience in data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling. I am passionate about turning data into actionable insights and developing models to solve real-world problems. 

## Projects

- [Credit Score Classification](https://github.com/Sandrog112/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Credit%20Score%20Classification.ipynb): This project involves building a classification model to predict the credit score for 100,000 customers based on their personal data. The model analyzes key features such as payment history, credit mix, and payment behavior to classify customers accurately. It leverages advanced machine learning techniques to ensure high predictive accuracy.

- [Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/Sandrog112/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Customer%20Churn%20Prediction.ipynb): This project focuses on predicting customer churn by analyzing personal data of customers who have already left the company. The model identifies patterns and key indicators of churn, enabling the business to take proactive measures to retain customers. It applies machine learning algorithms to forecast which customers are at risk of churning.

- [Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/Sandrog112/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Customer%20Segmentation.ipynb): This project segments mall customers into distinct groups based on their gender, age, annual income, and spending behavior. By applying clustering techniques, the model identifies patterns in customer demographics and spending habits, helping businesses to tailor marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.

- [Drug Classification](https://github.com/Sandrog112/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Drug%20Classification.ipynb): This project classifies patients into different drug categories based on their medical data, including age, gender, blood pressure levels, cholesterol levels, and sodium-to-potassium ratios. The model leverages machine learning algorithms to predict the most suitable drug for each patient, enhancing personalized treatment recommendations.

- [Loan Default Prediction](https://github.com/Sandrog112/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Loan%20Default%20Prediction%20Using%20Deep%20Learning.ipynb): This project utilizes deep learning techniques to predict loan defaults based on borrowers' financial and demographic data. The model analyzes various factors, such as credit history, income, and loan characteristics, to assess the likelihood of default. By accurately predicting defaults, it aids financial institutions in risk management and decision-making processes.

- [Recommender Systems](https://github.com/Sandrog112/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Recommender%20Systems.ipynb): This project implements four main types of recommender systems: popularity-based, content-based, user-based, and item-based. Each system utilizes customer ratings, personal data, movie ratings, and movie characteristics to deliver personalized recommendations. By analyzing user preferences alongside item features, the model enhances the user experience and drives engagement by suggesting relevant movies or products.

## Tools 

- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tensorflow, Keras)
- Jupyter Notebook
